<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I was born in Petaluma, California at the age of 0. My favorite things were milk, shitting my pants, sleeping and my mom.</p>

<p>I grew up outside of a small town called Sebastopol, aslo in California. My mom would lovingly call it "Some Bastard's Pool".</p>

<p>As an adult I've lived in many places: Mexico, Quebec, Las Vegas, New Orleans, Austin, Chattanooga, and Denial.</p>
